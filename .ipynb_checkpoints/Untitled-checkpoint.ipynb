We ran through all of the accounts and decided on the following: 1. We are going to sell the MLI and then liquidate Diana's LAE SEP 11111 - She is going to have to take a RMD this year and decided to go ahead and capture the 15% profit in the note. I sold the note on the secondary market - Once settled, Xyz will move the cash to the CMA. - No withholding2. We also agreed to liquidate and close Abcd's SEP 1111 Chris will request liquidation from CIO and once settled she will move the cash to the CMA - no withholding 3. Lastly we are going to raise approx. $7,600 from CIO Model (enough to get to $20k total) from Abcd's ROTH, 1111 Once settled, we will transfer the cash to the CMA.\"\n",
